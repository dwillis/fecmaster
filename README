A python app for importing all Federal Election Commission records from 1980 onward into a PostgreSQL database. These are the master files, updated weekly to an FTP server.

It is based largely off of the Sunlight Foundation's Data Commons (github: sunlightlabs), but is simpler/smaller in scope and also accomodates all election cycles.

To run:

createdb datacommons
python manage.py fecmasterrunonce 1990 [or whatever start year]

python manage.py fecmasterrunweekly
